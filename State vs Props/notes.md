# State vs Props

# State

- State is an object that stores data that can change over time and affects the componentâ€™s behavior or rendering.
- State is local to the component, meaning each component has its own state.
- State is mutable (it can be changed over time).

# Props

- Props (short for properties) are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component.
- Props are used to pass data and event handlers down to child components.
- Props are immutable: a child component cannot change the props it receives from its parent.
