# What is React Profiler ?

- React Profiler is a tool built into React for measuring the performance of your React components.
- It helps you understand how your components are rendering and why
- So you can optimize and improve the performance of your application
- The React Profiler allows you to track the time spent rendering components, identify unnecessary re-renders, and debug performance bottlenecks in your app.
- The Profiler API is part of the React Developer Tools, and it allows you to record performance information in a React component tree. You can see how long each render took, how often components rendered, and how they were updated.

# Why do we need to use React Profiler ?

- Performance Optimization
- Detecting Unnecessary Renders
- Debugging Rendering Bottlenecks
- Tracking Component Behavior
