# What is Component Composition ?

- Component composition in react refers to practice of building complex UI's by combining
  smaller , reusable components
- Instead of building a large monolithic component, You break down the ui into smaller resubale compoent
- later combine them to form a complete ui.
- The composition allows you to structure your application by nesting components inside one another or passing them as prop.

# Why Do We Need to Use Component Composition?

- Reusability : By creating smaller, reusable components, you can avoid code duplication. For example, a button component that is styled the same way can be used in multiple places throughout the app.
- Maintainability : When your UI is broken down into smaller components, it becomes easier to maintain and update specific parts of your app without affecting others. You can modify or update a component independently.
- Scalability : When building large applications, component composition helps to manage complexity. You can compose small components to create more complex ones, making it easier to scale the application over time
