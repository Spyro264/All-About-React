# What is React Element

- React element is a plain `Object` that representes a Dom node
- A React element describes what you want to see on the `screen`.
- React elements are created using either JSX syntax or `React.createElement()`.
- React elements are immutable, meaning once they're created, they donâ€™t change. Instead of modifying existing elements, React creates new elements for the next render cycle. This allows React to efficiently manage changes to the UI.

# How to create an Element

```
const h1 =  React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello, world!');

```

# React Element vs React Component

- A React element is a simple object describing a DOM node or component.
- A React component is a function or class that returns React elements. Components are reusable, and they can return elements based on props or state.
